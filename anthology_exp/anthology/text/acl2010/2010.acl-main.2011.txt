and preferences during content selection while Ex-
periment II looks at this trade-off for modifier
orderings during realization. Both studies use a
novel interactive reference production paradigm,
applied to two domains – the Furniture and People
domains of the TUNA data-set (Gatt et al., 2007;
Koolen et al., 2009) – to see whether adaptation
may be domain dependent. Finally, we contrast
our findings with the performance of state-of-the-
art REG algorithms, discussing how they could be
adapted so as to account for the new data, effec-
tively adding plasticity to the generation process.

2   Experiment I
Experiment I studies what speakers do when re-
ferring to a target that can be distinguished in a
preferred (the blue fan) or a dispreferred way (the
left-facing fan), when in the prior context either
the first or the second variant was made salient.

Method
Participants 26 students (2 male, mean age = 20
years, 11 months), all native speakers of Dutch
without hearing or speech problems, participated
for course credits.
Materials Target pictures were taken from the
TUNA corpus (Gatt et al., 2007) that has been
extensively used for REG evaluation. This cor-
pus consists of two domains: one containing pic-
tures of people (famous mathematicians), the other
containing furniture items in different colors de-
picted from different orientations. From previous
studies (Gatt et al., 2007; Koolen et al., 2009) it
is known that participants show a preference for
certain attributes: color in the Furniture domain
and glasses in the People domain, and disprefer
other attributes (orientation of a furniture piece
and wearing a tie, respectively).
Procedure Trials consisted of four turns in an in-
teractive reference understanding and production
experiment: a prime, two fillers and the experi-
mental description (see Figure 1). First, partici-          Figure 1: The 4 tasks per trial. A furniture trial is

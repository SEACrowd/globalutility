lent formulations using a large number of short
axioms at one extreme, and a small number of
long ones at the other. For many logical patterns,
rules can be stated for amalgamating or splitting
axioms while leaving overall content unchanged
(thus ensuring that exactly the same inferences are
drawn by a reasoning engine); such rules are often
used in reasoning algorithms. For instance, any set
